content: "<p class='regular'>The All-Aligned are an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_art' target='_blank'><strong>AI art generator</strong></a> of infinitely different flags, an expert system for vexillology, study of flags, and to a certain extent heraldry, study of coat of arms, ensigns, and armorial bearings.</p>   
    <p class='regular'>The software was written in Python (back-end) and JavaScript (front-end). The heart of the software consists of digital systems of statistical distributions for mapping semantics to graphics. Ideas and concepts (pirate, Balkan, libertarian, ecological, dark, etc.) are being mapped onto graphic elements (colors, layouts, symbols, new shapes, etc.).</p>
    <p class='regular'>The term “anarchy”, for example, increases the probability that the layout will be diagonal, that the palette will be black and red, and that a graphic version of the anarchist letter A will be extracted from the character base. Similarly, the term “ecological” is associated with shades of green, the term “student” with emblems student campuses, etc. It is up to the users to select the parameters (ideas and concepts), adjust the sliders and click <em>Generate</em>. With each new click, the software automatically produces completely new flags according to the entered parameters.</p>
    <p class='regular'>Currect version of the software is published <a href='https://github.com/parthenocissus' target='_blank'><strong>on GitHub as a free open source project</strong></a>. It means you can freely use it for your non-commercial and non-profit endeavours.</p>
    <p class='regular'>If you wish to support our project, think about <a href='/all-aligned/support' target='_blank'><strong>buying a unique flag as a physical object and a signed artwork</strong></a>.</p>"
