content: "<p class='regular'>The exhibition was organized after the international art residency <strong><a href='https://theylive.eu/' target='_blank'>They: Live – student lives revealed through context-based art practices</a></strong>. The residency, which was supported by Creative Europe and the Serbian Ministry of Culture, took place in the main student campuses of Belgrade, Madrid, Rijeka, Podgorica, and Novi Sad. As part of the residency, the selected artists and curators spent a month in the main student campus of their city.</p>
    <p class='regular'>In the spring of 2022, as a selected artist, Uroš Krčadinac moved to the Student City of Belgrade, with the intention of exploring student symbols, identities, and ways of life in the analog and digital world. Over 200 students participated in the workshops. They used the All-Aligned generator in order to choose/create their individual flags.</p>
    <p class='regular'>In June 2022, the exhibition took place in the Belgrade Student City Cultural Centre, which showed the flags created during student workshops. The exhibition raised questions about the relationship between technology and ideology. When we choose a flag, did we really choose it ourselves or did we just get caught on an automated hook? While scrolling and liking release our dopamine and serotonin, is our freedom of choice just a delusion? Do we rule the symbols or do they rule us? And in general, are there aesthetic solutions for structural problems?</p>
