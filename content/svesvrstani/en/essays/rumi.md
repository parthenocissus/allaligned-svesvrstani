content: "<p class='regular'>I used to want buyers for my words.<br>
Now I wish someone would buy me away from words.</p>
<p class='regular'>I have made a lot of charmingly profound images,<br>
scenes with Abraham and Abraham's father, Azar,<br>
who was famous for making icons.</p>
<p class='regular'>I am so tired of what I have been doing.</p>
<p class='regular'>Then one image without form came,<br>
and I quit.</p>
<p class='regular'>Look for someone else to tend the shop.<br>
I am out of the image-making business.</p>
<p class='regular'>Finally I know the freedom<br>
of madness.</p>
<p class='regular'>A random image arrives. I scream,<br>
Get out! It disintegrates.</p>
<p class='regular'>Only love.<br>
Only the holder the flag fits into.<br>
No flag.</p>"
